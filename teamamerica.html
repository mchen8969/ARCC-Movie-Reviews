                      <p style = 'white-space: pre-wrap;'>I wonder if anyone was offended by this film?! Well, like any production by the South Park team of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the answer is yup... After all, "Team America" is loaded with tons of expletives, really dirty puppet sex (funny puppet sex, actually) and it attacks Hollywood's self-appointed elite in a way no other film has. Yes, it will offend...and make folks laugh as long as they don't take it all very seriously.

The film begins with Team America and Muslim terrorists blowing up the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe (later the Great Pyramid and the Sphynx also are destroyed)! But, in the process, one of their team members is killed and can only be replaced by one person--an actor! And naturally, the purpose of the rest of the film is having this uncertain actor prove himself. But, despite this being a bit of a clich√©, everything else isn't! Yep, what other film would feature an unholy alliance between Kim Jong-Il and the Hollywood leftists?! And in the process, Parker and Stone savagely attack many of the same actors who originally promoted and admired their work. Some of them took it as a joke and enjoyed it, though some hated the film. As for me, I loved seeing these folks attacked so viciously, as normally whatever these folks say is hardly ever confronted or disputed--it's just accepted that they are experts on world affairs! And so, as I said in the summary, they bite the hand that once fed them.

I think to love the film you need to have a high tolerance for the cursing, the vomiting (and wow, there is A LOT of barf), the anti AND pro-American imperialist message and the sex. If you will be too offended by this (and the anti Hollywood left message) then don't watch and DON'T let your kids watch it regardless. But, I found that beneath all the crudeness was a refreshing freshness about the film--there ain't nothing like it! I think I also liked it because the film makers seem to attack everyone in their work--right, left and everything in-between. So, while the left is strongly attacked in the film, the right also is to a lesser extent and is often skewered on "South Park".

By the way, although it is politically incorrect, try switching on the captions when you watch the DVD. Kim Jong-Il's captioning is hilarious, as it is spelled exactly as he talks! Also, watch the special features, as they show you so many wonderful hidden things you could never notice even if you tried repeated viewings--such as the croissants.</p>

                      <p style = 'white-space: pre-wrap;'>Our adult son recommended this to my husband. Not me, just him.

We watched together anyway and oh my dear Lord, the humanity...and hilarity!

He was laughing crazy hard, eating popcorn and humming the theme song: America, *heck yeah!

One false move and he would have choked to death. It would have been worth it. Great, great movie.</p>

                      <p style = 'white-space: pre-wrap;'>The one thing I noticed while attempting to breathe during this movie was that people were walking out in between bursts of hysterical laughter.

Unfortunately, this movie is not for everyone. I wish it didn't offend some but it does. So, if you want to know whether you will enjoy this film or not, you must answer "yes" to the following:

1. I am not offended by the "F" word. Being repeated 300 times.

2. I am not offended by intense marionette sex.

3. I am not offended by racial satire.

4. I am not offended by ridiculous political satire.

5. I am not a member of the Film Actor's Guild.

If you're like me and have answered "yes" to the above five questions, go see this film. You will laugh so hard it will hurt and you will giggle about it for the next week thereafter.

I have to say that I am very desensitized when it comes these kinds of films, and I'd say that Team America has raised the bar in derogatory humor. But that only made it more hilarious. I give it 5 stars, two thumbs up, 10 out of 10; it was flawless. But...

On the other hand, if you're not like me, you might find yourself walking out by the third time you hear the song, "America, F*** Yeah!"</p>

I have watched it once every couple of years since it came out and I am still in awe of so many of the scenes after all this time. You just need to say "Jean pierre", "terrorise this","Hans Brix", "the signal","suck my...","three types of people" and I am mentally replaying each scene crying with laughter. A true masterpiece, python for the 21st century</p>
